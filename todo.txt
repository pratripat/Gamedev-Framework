BULLET PATTERNS

üéØ Bullet Hell Pattern Ideas
1. Single Shot
Basic bullet in the facing direction.

Use for pistols, enemies that track.

2. Triple Spread
Three bullets at slight angles (e.g., -15¬∞, 0¬∞, 15¬∞).

Shotgun-like spread.

3. Spiral
You already have this.

Angle rotates over time to create spirals.

4. Burst Spread
Fire 5‚Äì10 bullets in all directions in a single frame.

Think: ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù or circular attack.

5. Wave / Sine Wave
Bullets curve like a wave using a sine offset over time.

Edit
# Each projectile updates its own y-position like:
offset = amplitude * math.sin(frequency * elapsed_time)
6. Homing Bullets
Bullet rotates gradually to face target.

Needs target-tracking logic.

7. Delayed Burst
Shoot a slow-moving orb ‚Üí after a delay, it explodes into radial bullets.

8. Wall of Bullets
Fire a full row or arc of bullets toward the player.

Can combine with movement to make "moving wall".

9. Random Scatter
Bullets fly off in randomized directions within a cone.

Good for chaotic enemies.

10. Rotating Beam
Beam that rotates slowly around the enemy.

Can be implemented with collision segments instead of projectiles.

11. Ring of Orbiting Bullets
Bullets circle around an enemy, then shoot outward or inward.
